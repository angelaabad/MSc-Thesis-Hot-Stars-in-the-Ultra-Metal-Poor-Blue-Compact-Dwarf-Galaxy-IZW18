## Abstract
Throughout this thesis we investigate the distant blue compact dwarf galaxy I Zw 18. Known for its densely packed stellar population, notable ongoing star formation, and metallicity deficiency, I Zw 18 has been extensively analyzed in previous studies, serving as a perfect laboratory for understanding star formation and evolution in galaxies resembling primordial systems in the early Universe.

In this work, we principally focus on the detection and examination of the bluest, youngest stars within the galaxy. This is accomplished using HST/WFC3/UVIS data retrieved from the GO program 17129 (PI: G. Östlin), targeting the UV/blue part of the spectrum. Utilizing point-spread function (PSF) photometry with the DOLPHOT2.0 software, we performed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) analyses using filters F225W and F438W where we conducted isochrone and evolutionary track fitting adopting MIST and PARSEC models. We ended up revealing a resolved stellar population with an age span from ≈ (2.5 − 40) Myr and a characteristic clump of bright stars with masses up to ≈ 140 M⊙, including potential Wolf Rayet (WR) star candidates. Further analyses were carried out on the spatial distribution of stars within I Zw 18’s main body and its companion galaxy, Component C. Distinct patterns were identified, with the youngest stellar populations concentrating in the northwest (NW; Population A) and southeast (SE; Population C) areas – characterized with the highest star formation rates (SFRs) – and the slightly more evolved populations distributed around the outskirts. Component C was characterized as missing the youngest and brightest stellar component present in I Zw 18.

Reddening effects by dust were additionally evaluated through color-color diagrams (CCDs) by introducing a third filter (F336W) and through the application of the Milky Way (MW) and Small Megallenic Cloud (SMC) extinction laws. We confirmed that a modest and relatively uniform internal extinction was present within the main target, with a typical AV value ranging from ≈ 0.1 (for those stars solely affected by the foreground reddening) to ≈ 0.25 (those affected by an intrinsic extinction value).

Finally, we reconstructed the recent star formation histories (SFHs) of I Zw 18, Component C and Populations A and C, through the implementation of a synthetic CMD fitting routine called SFERA2.0. While the observational and modeled CMDs were in overall agreement, fitting challenges were evident – especially the most massive stellar clump, the reddest sources or those laying around the MS area of the isochrones were difficult to model, mainly due to completeness corrections, crowding effects and reddening assumptions. The SFHs indicate a strong burst in I Zw 18 over the last ≈ 10 Myr, with the most recent activity occurring in the NW region, followed by the SE area. This supports the idea that this stellar outburst could be driven by pristine in-falling gas from its companion, which itself shows signs of a relatively older stellar population and a decline in stellar formation for the past 10 Myr.

Future work could benefit from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to better constrain the intrinsic stellar parameters of the brightest, bluest stellar clumps. Further analysis of the SFHs of the galaxy, as well as its inner spatial regions, could be developed to ensure for more consistent models and better fitted results.
